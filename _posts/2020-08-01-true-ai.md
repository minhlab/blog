1. Not all AI are the same.
    - Most of the current research focused on narrow AI: software designed to perform a particular task or a few of them
    - Some researchers aspire to create conscious AI or artificial life.
2. The word "artifical intelligence" implies a powerful tool.
    - "Artificial" means man-made.
    - "Intelligence" is the ability to do useful things.
    - There's nothing in the word that implies consciousness or life-like properties.
3. True AI must be beneficial for humans
