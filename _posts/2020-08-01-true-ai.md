1. Not all AI are the same.
    - Most current research focused on narrow AI: software designed to perform a particular task or a few of them
    - Some researchers aspire to create conscious AI or artificial life.
2. The word "artifical intelligence" implies a powerful tool.
    - "Artificial" means man-made.
    - "Intelligence" is the ability to do useful things.
    - There's nothing in the word that implies consciousness or life-like properties.
3. True AI must be beneficial for humans
    - I consider this an axiom.
4. AI must always be a tool.
    - Artificial life will compete with humans for resources.
    - Conscious AI will update its goals and gradually drift from what is beneficial for humans.
    - It is ethically troublesome to control a conscious and highly intelligent entity.
5. AI must be widely and evenly distributed.
    - Tools confer power to their owners.
    - History proves that concentrated power brings misery to the majority.
    - More power means more misery and destruction.
6. True AI is general AI.
    - True AI can perform a variety of tasks with the same or higher performance than an adult human.
    - True AI can perform a new task well given little instructions (either in a natural language or programmatically) or training examples.
7. Where humans can generalize, true AI should generalize in the same way.
