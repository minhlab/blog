<h1>About me</h1>

As of 2020, I'm a PhD candidate at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and a data scientist at Elsevier.
In my spare time, I study possible routes to artificial general intenlligence (the beneficial kind).
My most recent interest is learning visual concepts to support common sense reasoning and 
solving adversarial examples.
